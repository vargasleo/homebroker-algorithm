_Algorithms and data structures II - PUC RS_

Using maxheap and minheap to build an priority queue to process stock trading in high volumes.

1. Input is a txt file where each line represents an buy or sell order
2. The algorithm read each line and close any possible deal with those offers
3. At the end, it calculates the profit made by the arbitrage

You can check the detailed problem statement [here](https://github.com/vargasleo/homebroker-algorithm/blob/main/problem-statement.pdf) (pt-br).

And my complete report, containing time-complexity analysis of the algorithm, [here](https://github.com/vargasleo/homebroker-algorithm/blob/main/latex-report.pdf) (pt-br).
